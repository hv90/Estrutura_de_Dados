|CNN Multi-surface cleaners and other commonly used household | 
|disinfectants could be making children overweight by altering the | 
|bacteria found in their guts, a new study published Monday in the | 
|Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests Infants living in | 
|households where antimicrobial disinfectants are used at least weekly | 
|were twice as likely to have higher levels of the bacteria | 
|Lachnospiraceae at ages 3 to 4 months than children whose homes did | 
|not frequently use disinfectants the Canadian researchers found When | 
|those children with higher levels of Lachnospiraceae were 3 years old | 
|their body mass index BMI was higher than children who do not live | 
|in homes that frequently use disinfectants the study also showed | 
|White bread or whole-wheat? It may depend on your gut White bread or | 
|whole-wheat? It may depend on your gut The bacteria Lachnospiraceae | 
|are a normal component of our gut microbiota Anita Kozyrskyj senior | 
|author of the study and a University of Alberta pediatrics professor | 
|said in a CMAJ podcast However she explained that it is known from | 
|animal studies that higher levels of Lachnospiraceae have been | 
|associated with higher body fat and insulin resistance Culprit | 
|linking disinfectant use and weight The new report uses data from the | 
|Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study which began in | 
|2009 with researchers actively following participants as they grow | 
|and develop from mid-pregnancy into childhood and adolescence When | 
|infants were 3 or 4 months old their parents provided a poop sample | 
|for each infant and answered questions about their home explained | 
|Kozyrskyj Samples from 757 infants were profiled and analyzed along | 
|with BMI data at older ages and parental use of disinfectant products|
